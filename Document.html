 <p style="margin-left: 250px; text-align: justify;">
My father was born on May 5, 1985, in Hisaamuddin Pur, a small village in Ayodhya. He completed his education up to the 12th grade. Throughout his life, he faced many challenges and hardships, but he never allowed these obstacles to defeat him.

In 2002, he got married and soon after moved to Yamunanagar district in Haryana, hoping to build a better career. Despite his relentless efforts, success did not come easily. He encountered many setbacks and disappointments, but he never lost hope or gave up.

Driven by the desire to provide a good education for his children, my father worked tirelessly, often sacrificing his own comfort for our future. Over time, his hard work began to yield results. Slowly but surely, he started to achieve success. He was able to buy a tractor and expand his work, marking a significant milestone in his journey.

Even today, my father continues to work with unwavering dedication to ensure his children have the best opportunities in life. His perseverance, resilience, and commitment to his family are truly inspiring. My father is my role model, and his story motivates me every day to work hard and never give up.</p>

<p style="margin-right: 250px; text-align: justify;">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was a key leader in India’s struggle for independence from British rule. Born in 1869, Gandhi trained as a lawyer but became renowned for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, or Satyagraha. His approach to protest—using peaceful civil disobedience rather than violence—became a powerful tool in the fight for civil rights and freedom, not just in India but around the world.

Gandhi led several major movements, including the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920–22), the Salt March (1930), and the Quit India Movement (1942), each mobilizing millions of Indians to peacefully oppose British laws and policies. He also worked tirelessly for social reforms, campaigning against the caste system and untouchability, and advocating for the rights of marginalized communities and women.

Beyond politics, Gandhi promoted self-reliance through the Swadeshi movement, urging people to use local products and support rural industries. He believed in simplicity, truth, and living in harmony with nature. Gandhi’s commitment to nonviolence and justice inspired global leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Even after India’s independence in 1947, Gandhi continued to work for communal harmony until his assassination in 1948. His legacy of peace, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide</p>

  <h1 style="margin-left: 600px; color: rgb(161, 16, 11);">MOTHER TERESA</h1>
 
<p style="margin-right: 250px; text-align: justify;">Mother Teresa, born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, was a Roman Catholic nun renowned for her lifelong dedication to serving the poorest and most vulnerable. She moved to India in her youth, where she founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950, an organization devoted to providing “wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.” Under her leadership, the Missionaries of Charity grew to operate in over 130 countries, running homes for the dying, orphanages, leprosy centers, and soup kitchens.

Mother Teresa’s humanitarian work was marked by compassion and a commitment to dignity for all, regardless of background or faith. She opened the first Home for the Dying, Nirmal Hriday, in Kolkata, and established Shanti Nagar for leprosy patients, as well as homes for abandoned children. Her efforts to promote interfaith harmony and peace earned her international acclaim, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and India’s highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna.

Despite facing criticism for her views and the conditions in some of her homes, Mother Teresa’s legacy as a symbol of selfless service endures. She was canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta in 2016, and her life continues to inspire millions worldwide</p>
